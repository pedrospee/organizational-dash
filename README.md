# Solvia

A personal finance management application built around a real personal need: organizing, planning and understanding finances across multiple accounts, currencies, debts, goals and future obligations.

This project is also a personal experiment in **vibecoding** and AI-assisted software development: how far can a useful, maintainable application go when human-defined requirements, business rules and architectural decisions are combined with AI-assisted implementation?

## About the author and the use of AI

I am a junior developer, and this project is also how I am learning. Most of the processes used here are new to me: layered architecture, double-entry modelling, test-first financial rules, strict TypeScript, linting, Git hooks and secret scanning.

This is how the work is divided:

| I do | AI (Claude Code) does |
| --- | --- |
| Define the requirements and the financial rules | Propose architecture options and trade-offs |
| Make every architectural decision | Write most of the implementation and tests |
| Review, run and validate every phase before approving it | Explain the code and the reasoning behind it |
| Decide what is built next and what is left out | Flag ambiguities, risks and inconsistencies |

The AI is a development tool and a tutor. It is not the source of truth for financial decisions or requirements. Every phase is reviewed and approved by me before the next one starts.

## Why this project exists

Spreadsheets become hard to maintain as financial complexity grows. I wanted a single system that answers:

- What do I currently have?
- What do I owe?
- What is coming next?
- How much can I actually spend?
- How are my debts progressing?
- Am I on track toward my financial goals?
- How does my financial position change across EUR and BRL?

## Development approach

- **Human-defined requirements and financial rules**, written down before any code
- **AI-assisted implementation**, reviewed and validated by me
- **Small phases**, each approved before the next one starts
- **Automated tests** for every important financial rule
- **Simple, maintainable architecture**: a pure TypeScript financial core, independent of database and UI
- **No real personal financial data** in the repository

## Project status

Early development. The financial core exists and the repository is a monorepo ready for the backend; there is no database or user interface yet.

| Phase | Scope | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Foundation: TypeScript, Vitest, Biome, Git hooks, documentation | ✅ Done |
| 1 | Financial core: money, exchange rates, double-entry ledger | ✅ Done |
| 2A | Monorepo (npm workspaces), CI, Dependabot | ✅ Done |
| 2B–2C | Persistence (SQLite), accounts, transactions, backup, minimal UI | Next |
| 3–12 | Debts, credit cards, planning, payoff simulator, goals, analytics, dashboard, investments, integrations, advanced security | Planned |

The full roadmap and rules are in [docs/](docs/).

## Getting started

Requires Node.js 24 LTS and [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks).

```sh
npm install
npm run check   # typecheck + lint + tests, every workspace
npm run dev     # run the backend, restarting on change
```

## Repository structure

An npm workspaces monorepo ([ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-monorepo-with-npm-workspaces.md)):

```text
packages/core   @solvia/core      pure financial core: money, exchange rates, ledger
backend         @solvia/backend   configuration and bootstrap; API and database from Phase 2B
docs            requirements, rules, architecture and decision records
```

## Tech stack

| In use | Planned |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js 24, TypeScript (strict), npm workspaces, Zod, Vitest, Biome, Gitleaks, GitHub Actions | SQLite, Drizzle ORM, Hono (Phase 2B), React + Vite (Phase 2C) |

## Important note

This is a **personal project and an experiment**, not a financial product or a professional financial advice tool. Every estimate it produces is based only on the data entered into it.

Real financial data must never be committed to this repository.
